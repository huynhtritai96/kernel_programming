### 1. **Introduce about yourself**
   This question typically expects a brief introduction about your professional background, skills, and key projects. Focus on your experience, technologies you're proficient in, and any key achievements.

   Example:  
   "I'm a software developer with 5 years of experience in embedded systems and networking. I have a deep understanding of OSI layers, network protocols like TCP/IP, and have worked extensively with C/C++ for low-level programming."

### 2. **What are your duties in the Smart Link Aggregation project?**
   Smart Link Aggregation is likely related to network bandwidth aggregation (combining multiple network interfaces into a single logical interface). Your duties could involve:
   - Configuring the aggregation
   - Optimizing performance
   - Implementing fault tolerance
   - Debugging networking issues

   Example task:  
   "I was responsible for implementing the link aggregation layer, ensuring load balancing across multiple network interfaces, and minimizing downtime by switching to backup interfaces on failure."

### 3. **How do you filter incoming packets?**
   Filtering packets generally involves inspecting packet headers (IP addresses, port numbers, etc.) and determining whether to allow, block, or redirect them. You can implement packet filtering using firewall rules (iptables) or in C using raw sockets.

   Example (Linux `iptables`):  
   ```bash
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT  # Allow SSH traffic
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP    # Block HTTP traffic
   ```

### 4. **Which OSI layer do you work on?**
   This question asks about which layer of the OSI model your work typically deals with. Examples:
   - Layer 2 (Data Link) if you're working on Ethernet protocols, VLANs, etc.
   - Layer 3 (Network) if you're handling IP routing and packet forwarding.

### 5. **Do you know VLAN? How does `ping` work?**
   - **VLAN**: A Virtual Local Area Network is used to create logically separate networks within a physical network, improving security and reducing broadcast traffic.
   - **Ping**: It uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to send Echo Request packets to a target and waits for an Echo Reply. It helps verify network connectivity.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ping google.com
   ```

### 6. **Do you know about inter-process communication (IPC)?**
   IPC allows processes to communicate and share data. Common IPC mechanisms include:
   - **Pipes**
   - **Message Queues**
   - **Shared Memory**
   - **Semaphores**

   Example (C code using pipes):
   ```c
   int pipefd[2];
   pipe(pipefd); // Creates a pipe
   ```

### 7. **What are the differences between TCP & UDP sockets?**
   - **TCP**: Connection-oriented, reliable transmission, ordered data transfer (used in applications like HTTP, FTP).
   - **UDP**: Connectionless, no guarantee of delivery, suitable for real-time applications like video streaming, VoIP.

### 8. **What are the differences between processes & threads?**
   - **Process**: Independent execution unit with its own memory space.
   - **Thread**: A smaller unit of a process, shares the same memory space with other threads in the process, but has its own execution context.

### 9. **How does `fork()` work?**
   `fork()` creates a new child process that is a copy of the parent process. The child process has its own memory space.

   Example (C code):
   ```c
   pid_t pid = fork();
   if (pid == 0) {
       // Child process
       printf("This is the child process\n");
   } else {
       // Parent process
       printf("This is the parent process\n");
   }
   ```

### 10. **Can we fork a child process to print only odd numbers while the parent prints only even numbers?**
   Yes, you can use `fork()` and let the child and parent handle odd and even number printing respectively. 

   Example (C code):
   ```c
   pid_t pid = fork();
   if (pid == 0) {
       // Child prints odd numbers
       for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i += 2) {
           printf("%d\n", i);
       }
   } else {
       // Parent prints even numbers
       for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
           printf("%d\n", i);
       }
   }
   ```

### 11. **Do you know memory layout & dynamic allocation?**
   - **Memory Layout**: Typically consists of segments like text (code), data (global variables), heap (dynamically allocated memory), and stack (local variables).
   - **Dynamic Allocation**: Allocating memory at runtime using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and freeing it using `free`.

### 12. **Can you tell the differences between kmalloc, vmalloc & malloc?**
   - **kmalloc**: Allocates physically contiguous memory in kernel space.
   - **vmalloc**: Allocates virtually contiguous memory in kernel space (can be physically non-contiguous).
   - **malloc**: Allocates memory in user space.

### 13. **How do you implement dynamic allocation?**
   Dynamic memory allocation is done using `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc` in C.

   Example:
   ```c
   int *arr = (int*) malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
   if (arr == NULL) {
       // Handle allocation failure
   }
   ```

### 14. **Print elements from `int a[5] = {0,1,2,3,4}`**
   Example code:
   ```c
   int a[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       printf("%d ", a[i]);
   }
   ```

### 15. **Sum the digits of a given integer**
   Example:
   ```c
   int sum_of_digits(int n) {
       int sum = 0;
       while (n != 0) {
           sum += n % 10;
           n /= 10;
       }
       return sum;
   }
   ```

### 16. **Print 100 times "Hello" without using loop/goto**
   You can use recursion to achieve this.

   Example:
   ```c
   void print_hello(int n) {
       if (n <= 0) return;
       printf("Hello\n");
       print_hello(n - 1);
   }

   int main() {
       print_hello(100);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

### 17. **What is the maximum value of type char?**
   The maximum value of `char` depends on whether it's signed or unsigned:
   - Signed `char`: Maximum value is `127`
   - Unsigned `char`: Maximum value is `255`

### 18. **Given `char a=500;` What is the result of `printf("%d",a)`?**
   If `char` is signed, the value `500` wraps around. For a typical 8-bit `char`, `500 % 256 = 244`. If `char` is unsigned, the output will be `244`.

### 19. **What is the result of the function `fun()`?**
   In this example, `x` is a local variable within the `fun` function and isn't affected by the `main` function's value. The output will be `30`.

### 20. **Do you know struct and union? How do you implement a linked list using struct?**
   - **Struct**: A collection of different data types.
   - **Union**: A collection where all members share the same memory space.
   - **Linked List**: Can be implemented using structs.

   Example:
   ```c
   struct Node {
       int data;
       struct Node* next;
   };
   ```

I'll continue this explanation for other questions if needed, but let me know which specific ones you'd like more detail on!

### 2. **Hiep Duong**

#### 1. **Introduce about yourself and your project?**
   This question expects a brief introduction about your role, skills, and the project you're working on. You could describe the projectâ€™s scope, technologies involved, and your specific contribution.

   Example:  
   "I am working on an embedded systems project involving real-time temperature monitoring for industrial applications. My responsibilities include designing the sensor interface using I2C, ensuring accurate data transfer, and handling power efficiency in the system."

#### 2. **I2C data transfer and how does it work?**
   I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a serial communication protocol used to connect low-speed peripherals to microcontrollers. It uses two wires:
   - **SCL (Serial Clock)**: Provides the clock signal.
   - **SDA (Serial Data)**: Transfers data between devices.

   The I2C communication involves a master device that initiates communication and one or more slave devices that respond.

   Example Code (Arduino I2C communication):
   ```c
   #include <Wire.h>
   void setup() {
       Wire.begin(); // Join I2C bus as a master
   }
   void loop() {
       Wire.beginTransmission(8); // Address of slave
       Wire.write("Temperature"); // Send request
       Wire.endTransmission();
       delay(1000);
   }
   ```

#### 3. **Explain the flow of the temperature monitoring project?**
   In a temperature monitoring project, the process typically involves:
   - Reading temperature data from a sensor (like a thermistor or digital sensor).
   - Using I2C or another communication protocol to transfer the data to the microcontroller.
   - Processing the data to ensure accuracy.
   - Taking appropriate actions based on temperature thresholds, such as triggering cooling systems or alarms.

   Example flow:
   - **Step 1**: Sensor sends temperature data via I2C.
   - **Step 2**: MCU (Microcontroller Unit) receives data and checks the current value.
   - **Step 3**: If the temperature exceeds a threshold, trigger a fan.

#### 4. **How kernel space and user space communicate in your project?**
   Communication between kernel space and user space is typically handled using:
   - **System calls**: User space requests services from the kernel.
   - **ioctl**: Allows user space programs to send control or configuration requests to kernel modules.

   Example:
   - In a Linux-based project, you might use a device driver to expose the temperature readings to user space.
   - `read()` system call or `ioctl` can be used to communicate between user and kernel space.

#### 5. **After getting the temperature value, next action?**
   After acquiring the temperature value, several actions could be taken, depending on the requirements:
   - **Logging**: Store the value in memory or send it to a server for logging.
   - **Threshold Handling**: If the temperature exceeds a defined limit, trigger an action (e.g., turning on a cooling system or shutting down a device).
   - **User Notification**: Send a warning if the temperature is too high or too low.

#### 6. **How does user space read the value?**
   User space can read values from the kernel via system calls like `read()`, or through `/proc` or `/sys` file systems in Linux. You might also use `ioctl` to retrieve sensor data.

   Example:
   - The kernel driver exposes the temperature value through `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp`, which user space can read using `cat` or programmatically via `fopen`.

#### 7. **Function with parameters (integer number, offset). You have to toggle the bit at that offset.**
   To toggle a bit at a given offset in an integer, you can use bitwise operations.

   Example code:
   ```c
   int toggle_bit(int num, int offset) {
       return num ^ (1 << offset);  // XOR toggles the bit at the given offset
   }

   int main() {
       int num = 5;    // Binary: 101
       int offset = 1;
       int result = toggle_bit(num, offset);  // Toggles bit at position 1
       printf("Result: %d\n", result);  // Output will be 7 (111 in binary)
   }
   ```

#### 8. **The scenario of power consumption?**
   Power consumption scenarios in embedded systems include:
   - **Idle Mode**: When the system is not processing any data, peripherals are in low-power mode.
   - **Active Mode**: When the system is actively processing data, the microcontroller consumes more power.
   - **Sleep Mode**: The system enters a low-power state, reducing power consumption drastically until an interrupt or event wakes it up.

   Techniques to reduce power consumption:
   - Use **power-efficient sensors**.
   - Implement **sleep modes** in microcontrollers when idle.
   - Use **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** for power control in peripherals like fans.

---

### 3. **Sang Vo**

#### 1. **Introduce recent project?**
   You are expected to describe a recent project you've worked on. Highlight its objectives, your role, the technology stack, and the impact.

   Example:  
   "I recently worked on a network optimization project that aimed to reduce packet loss and increase throughput in a cloud-based application. I was responsible for configuring TCP window scaling and improving the efficiency of packet processing using DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit)."

#### 2. **Ask some questions related to the project in CV?**
   When asked about a project from your CV, be prepared to explain:
   - The project's challenges and how you solved them.
   - Technologies used (network protocols, programming languages, frameworks).
   - Performance improvements or optimization techniques applied.

#### 3. **How to use Valgrind? What is it used for?**
   **Valgrind** is a tool used to detect memory leaks, memory corruption, and improper memory usage in programs.

   Example usage:
   ```bash
   valgrind --leak-check=full ./your_program
   ```
   Valgrind helps ensure that memory is properly allocated and freed, preventing issues such as segmentation faults and memory leaks.

#### 4. **VLAN protocol?**
   **VLAN (Virtual LAN)** is used to create logically separated networks on the same physical network. It improves network security and reduces broadcast traffic.

   Example:
   - In a corporate environment, you might create separate VLANs for different departments (HR, IT) to isolate their traffic.

#### 5. **Compare OSI vs TCP/IP? When to use?**
   - **OSI Model**: A 7-layer model (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, etc.) that provides a standard for networking communication.
   - **TCP/IP Model**: A more practical 4-layer model (Link, Internet, Transport, Application) that focuses on protocols used on the internet (e.g., TCP, IP).

   Use case:
   - When studying protocols, **OSI** helps in understanding each layer in detail.
   - **TCP/IP** is more commonly used in real-world networking.

#### 6. **How to communicate between user and kernel space?**
   - **System Calls**: Functions provided by the kernel that user-space applications can call to request services.
   - **ioctl**: A system call for device-specific input/output operations and other operations which are not covered by regular system calls.

   Example of reading from `/dev/`:
   ```c
   int fd = open("/dev/my_device", O_RDONLY);
   read(fd, buffer, size);
   ```

#### 7. **Steps to create a socket?**
   The steps to create a TCP socket in C:
   1. Create the socket using `socket()`.
   2. Bind the socket to an address using `bind()`.
   3. Listen for incoming connections using `listen()`.
   4. Accept a connection using `accept()`.
   5. Read and write data using `read()` and `write()`.

   Example:
   ```c
   int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   struct sockaddr_in serv_addr;
   bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr));
   listen(sockfd, 5);
   int new_sock = accept(sockfd, NULL, NULL);
   ```

#### 8. **How to collect information from CPU, port, memory?**
   On a Linux system, information about CPU, ports, and memory can be collected using:
   - **CPU**: `cat /proc/cpuinfo`
   - **Memory**: `cat /proc/meminfo`
   - **Network Ports**: `netstat -tuln`

#### 9. **How to support IPv4 and IPv6 (ask because my CV mentioned)?**
   To support both **IPv4** and **IPv6**, you need to modify the networking code to handle both address types. This involves:
   - Handling the differences in address lengths (32-bit vs 128-bit).
   - Updating the code to use `struct sockaddr_storage`, which can store both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

   Example of socket creation for IPv6:
   ```c
   struct sockaddr_in6 addr6;
   sockfd = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   ```

I see you've uploaded another image with a set of technical questions. Let's go through each one, explaining the concepts, and providing examples and code where necessary.

---

### 4. **Kien Dang**

#### 1. **Don't introduce yourself. Don't talk about past projects.**

This line suggests that the interview is focused more on problem-solving and coding rather than your past experiences or introductions. The goal is to dive straight into technical questions.

#### 2. **Do you know Stack, Queue? How do they work?**
   - **Stack**: A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top. Operations include `push` (add an element), `pop` (remove the top element), and `peek` (view the top element without removing it).
   
   - **Queue**: A queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the back and removed from the front. Operations include `enqueue` (add an element) and `dequeue` (remove an element).

#### 3. **Coding: Implement the Stack**

   Stack implementation in C:
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #define MAX 100

   int stack[MAX];
   int top = -1;

   void push(int value) {
       if (top == MAX - 1) {
           printf("Stack overflow\n");
       } else {
           stack[++top] = value;
       }
   }

   int pop() {
       if (top == -1) {
           printf("Stack underflow\n");
           return -1;
       } else {
           return stack[top--];
       }
   }

   int peek() {
       if (top == -1) {
           printf("Stack is empty\n");
           return -1;
       } else {
           return stack[top];
       }
   }

   int main() {
       push(10);
       push(20);
       printf("Top element is %d\n", peek());
       pop();
       printf("Top element after pop is %d\n", peek());
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### 4. **Do you know the Linked List?**
   A **linked list** is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next node. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory and can grow dynamically.

   - **Singly Linked List**: Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.
   - **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.

#### 5. **Coding: Implement the linked list (insert/delete operations)**

   Example code for a singly linked list with insert and delete operations:
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>

   struct Node {
       int data;
       struct Node* next;
   };

   struct Node* head = NULL;

   void insert(int value) {
       struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
       newNode->data = value;
       newNode->next = head;
       head = newNode;
   }

   void delete(int value) {
       struct Node* temp = head, *prev = NULL;
       if (temp != NULL && temp->data == value) {
           head = temp->next;
           free(temp);
           return;
       }
       while (temp != NULL && temp->data != value) {
           prev = temp;
           temp = temp->next;
       }
       if (temp == NULL) return;
       prev->next = temp->next;
       free(temp);
   }

   void printList() {
       struct Node* temp = head;
       while (temp != NULL) {
           printf("%d -> ", temp->data);
           temp = temp->next;
       }
       printf("NULL\n");
   }

   int main() {
       insert(10);
       insert(20);
       insert(30);
       printf("Linked List: ");
       printList();
       delete(20);
       printf("After Deletion: ");
       printList();
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### 6. **Coding: Print reverse of a Linked List without actually reversing**

   The idea is to use recursion to print the elements in reverse order.

   Example:
   ```c
   void printReverse(struct Node* node) {
       if (node == NULL)
           return;
       printReverse(node->next);  // Recursion
       printf("%d -> ", node->data);
   }

   int main() {
       // Assuming the linked list is already created
       printf("Reversed Linked List: ");
       printReverse(head);
       printf("NULL\n");
   }
   ```



#### 7. **Coding: Detect a loop or cycle in a linked list (explain the idea first)**

   The **Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm** (Tortoise and Hare) is used to detect loops in a linked list. You maintain two pointers: a slow pointer that moves one step at a time and a fast pointer that moves two steps at a time. If there is a loop, the two pointers will eventually meet.

   Example:
   ```c
   int detectLoop(struct Node* head) {
       struct Node *slow = head, *fast = head;
       while (slow && fast && fast->next) {
           slow = slow->next;
           fast = fast->next->next;
           if (slow == fast) {
               printf("Loop detected\n");
               return 1;
           }
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### 8. **Coding: Program for Nth node from the end of a Linked List (explain the idea first)**

   The idea is to use two pointers. Move the first pointer `n` nodes ahead, and then start the second pointer from the head. When the first pointer reaches the end, the second pointer will be at the Nth node from the end.

   Example:
   ```c
   void printNthFromEnd(struct Node* head, int n) {
       struct Node *first = head, *second = head;
       for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
           if (first == NULL) {
               printf("Not enough nodes\n");
               return;
           }
           first = first->next;
       }
       while (first != NULL) {
           first = first->next;
           second = second->next;
       }
       printf("Nth node from end: %d\n", second->data);
   }
   ```

#### 9. **Coding: Write a function to get the intersection node of two Linked Lists (explain the idea first)**

   The idea is to find the length of both lists and advance the pointer of the longer list by the difference in lengths. Then, traverse both lists together to find the intersection point.

   Example:
   ```c
   struct Node* getIntersectionNode(struct Node* head1, struct Node* head2) {
       int len1 = 0, len2 = 0;
       struct Node *temp1 = head1, *temp2 = head2;
       while (temp1 != NULL) {
           len1++;
           temp1 = temp1->next;
       }
       while (temp2 != NULL) {
           len2++;
           temp2 = temp2->next;
       }
       temp1 = head1;
       temp2 = head2;
       if (len1 > len2) {
           for (int i = 0; i < len1 - len2; i++)
               temp1 = temp1->next;
       } else {
           for (int i = 0; i < len2 - len1; i++)
               temp2 = temp2->next;
       }
       while (temp1 && temp2) {
           if (temp1 == temp2)
               return temp1;
           temp1 = temp1->next;
           temp2 = temp2->next;
       }
       return NULL;
   }
   ```
method 2:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Definition of a linked list node
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};

// Function to create a new node
struct Node* newNode(int data) {
    struct Node* node = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    node->data = data;
    node->next = NULL;
    return node;
}

// Function to find the intersection node of two linked lists
struct Node* getIntersectionNode(struct Node* head1, struct Node* head2) {
    if (head1 == NULL || head2 == NULL) {
        return NULL;
    }

    struct Node* temp1 = head1;
    struct Node* temp2 = head2;

    // Traverse both lists
    while (temp1 != temp2) {
        // Move temp1 to the head of the second list if it reaches the end
        temp1 = (temp1 == NULL) ? head2 : temp1->next;
        
        // Move temp2 to the head of the first list if it reaches the end
        temp2 = (temp2 == NULL) ? head1 : temp2->next;
    }

    // Either they meet at the intersection node or both will become NULL (no intersection)
    return temp1;
}

// Function to print a linked list
void printList(struct Node* head) {
    while (head != NULL) {
        printf("%d -> ", head->data);
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("NULL\n");
}

int main() {
    // Create two linked lists
    // List 1: 1 -> 2 -> 3
    //                     \
    //                      6 -> 7 -> NULL
    //                     /
    // List 2:       4 -> 5

    struct Node* head1 = newNode(1);
    head1->next = newNode(2);
    head1->next->next = newNode(3);

    struct Node* head2 = newNode(4);
    head2->next = newNode(5);

    struct Node* intersection = newNode(6);
    intersection->next = newNode(7);

    // Linking the intersection
    head1->next->next->next = intersection; // 3 -> 6
    head2->next->next = intersection;       // 5 -> 6

    // Print both lists
    printf("List 1: ");
    printList(head1);
    printf("List 2: ");
    printList(head2);

    // Find and print the intersection node
    struct Node* intersectNode = getIntersectionNode(head1, head2);
    if (intersectNode != NULL) {

    } else {
        printf("No intersection\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

#### 10. **Give the examples of L2/L3 protocols**

   - **L2 Protocols (Data Link Layer)**:
     - Ethernet
     - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
     - PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)

   - **L3 Protocols (Network Layer)**:
     - IP (Internet Protocol)
     - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
     - OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

#### 11. **What is ARP protocol? How does it work?**
   - **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses. When a device wants to send data to another device on the same network, it uses ARP to find the MAC address of the target device based on its IP address.

   Example:
   - If a device with IP `192.168.1.1` wants to communicate with `192.168.1.2`, it broadcasts an ARP request asking "Who has IP `192.168.1.2`?". The device with `192.168.1.2` responds with its MAC address.

#### 12. **What is DHCP protocol? How does it work?**
   - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration to devices on a network.
   - The DHCP process involves four steps:
     1. **Discover**: The client sends a broadcast message looking for a DHCP server.
     2. **Offer**: The DHCP server responds with an available IP address.
     3. **Request**: The client requests the offered IP.
     4. **Acknowledge**: The server confirms the lease of the IP address

.

#### 13. **What do the routing protocols do?**
   - **Routing protocols**: Determine the best path for data to travel across a network. They update routing tables to ensure packets take the most efficient route. Common routing protocols include:
     - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**
     - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**
     - **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**

#### 14. **Do you know OSPF? Tell me a little bit about how OSPF works.**
   - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: A link-state routing protocol used to find the best path between the source and destination routers in an IP network.
   - It uses the Dijkstra algorithm to compute the shortest path tree for each router. OSPF routers exchange information with all other routers in the same area to maintain an up-to-date routing table.

#### 15. **How to ping from D1 to D3?**

   The diagram isn't fully clear, but typically, to ping from one device (D1) to another (D3), you would:
   - Ensure that the network connectivity between D1 and D3 is established (i.e., routes exist).
   - Use the `ping` command:
     ```bash
     ping <D3's IP address>
     ```

#### 16. **Do you know socket? List all system calls used on the server and client sites.**
   **Sockets** provide a way to communicate between processes, either on the same machine or across a network.

   - **Server-side system calls**:
     1. `socket()` â€“ Creates a socket.
     2. `bind()` â€“ Binds the socket to an address.
     3. `listen()` â€“ Listens for incoming connections.
     4. `accept()` â€“ Accepts a connection.
     5. `recv()` â€“ Receives data from the client.
     6. `send()` â€“ Sends data to the client.
     7. `close()` â€“ Closes the socket.

   - **Client-side system calls**:
     1. `socket()` â€“ Creates a socket.
     2. `connect()` â€“ Connects to a server.
     3. `send()` â€“ Sends data to the server.
     4. `recv()` â€“ Receives data from the server.
     5. `close()` â€“ Closes the socket.

### Hau Nguyen

#### 1. **Introduce about me**
   This question typically expects a brief introduction about your professional background, your current role, and your skills. Highlight key projects you have worked on, especially related to the field of embedded systems or networking.

   Example:  
   "I am an embedded systems engineer with experience in developing and deploying networking protocols on PowerPC architecture. I specialize in low-level kernel development, hardware integration, and performance optimization for L2/L3 protocols."

#### 2. **Can you please share about the project Network Element?**
   You need to describe your involvement in the **Network Element** project. Provide details such as:
   - The goal of the project (e.g., implementing network switching or routing functionalities).
   - The technologies or protocols involved (L2/L3 switching, PowerPC architecture, etc.).
   - Your contribution, such as defining the software requirements document (SwRD), implementation, and handling specific challenges in network elements.

#### 3. **Chip use for L2/L3 switching**
   This question focuses on the hardware chip used for Layer 2/Layer 3 switching. You might discuss specific chips like:
   - **Broadcom** chips for switches (often used for L2/L3 switching in enterprise networks).
   - **Marvell** or **Intel** chips used in network devices.

   The chip would implement packet forwarding, VLAN handling, and routing based on MAC and IP addresses.

#### 4. **What is your role in this project?**
   The answer depends on your involvement. If you were both a **developer and tech lead**, you could mention:
   - Gathering requirements from the customer.
   - Defining the software and hardware architecture.
   - Implementing critical modules.
   - Leading the team in debugging and performance optimization.

#### 5. **Can you describe a little bit about Hardware monitoring in this project?**
   Hardware monitoring typically refers to keeping track of various system parameters like temperature, voltage, and current in the embedded system. This can involve:
   - Reading data from sensors (e.g., temperature or power sensors) via protocols like I2C, SPI, or GPIO.
   - Ensuring that the system is operating within safe parameters.

#### 6. **What is implemented in the kernel to communicate with this sensor?**
   Communication with hardware sensors is typically handled through kernel modules or drivers. The **device tree** is used in systems like PowerPC to describe the hardware components. The driver reads sensor data through the I2C or SPI protocol.

   Example:
   - A device driver in Linux communicates with hardware sensors via the I2C bus by registering the device and handling the data transfer using I2C APIs.

#### 7. **How does the kernel know the correct address or detect the sensor?**
   The kernel knows the sensor's address through the **device tree** configuration. The device tree contains the hardware information and is used during the boot process to tell the kernel about available devices.

   Example (device tree snippet):
   ```dts
   i2c@40005400 {
       temperature-sensor@48 {
           compatible = "sensor,temp";
           reg = <0x48>;
       };
   }
   ```

#### 8. **Kernel Migration -> What is the biggest challenge in this task?**
   Challenges in kernel migration could include:
   - Ensuring compatibility with new hardware architectures (e.g., moving from x86 to ARM or PowerPC).
   - Handling new drivers or adapting old drivers for new architectures.
   - Addressing timing issues or interrupt handling across different platforms.

#### 9. **How do you debug kernel issues?**
   Kernel debugging is typically done using:
   - **dmesg** logs: Checking for kernel messages.
   - **gdb** or **kgdb**: Kernel-level debuggers.
   - **printk** statements: Inserting debug logs in kernel code to trace execution flow.

   Example:
   ```c
   printk(KERN_INFO "Debugging message: Value of x is %d\n", x);
   ```

#### 10. **Have you faced issues with the spin_lock or kernel crashes?**
   Spinlocks are used in the kernel to manage concurrency in multicore systems. They can cause kernel crashes or deadlocks if misused. Examples of issues include:
   - Holding a spinlock for too long, which can prevent other threads from making progress.
   - Recursive locks leading to deadlocks.

   Example of spinlock usage:
   ```c
   spinlock_t my_lock;
   spin_lock(&my_lock);
   // Critical section
   spin_unlock(&my_lock);
   ```

#### 11. **How do you deliver or notify the user once an event happens (power down, high temperature)?**
   Notifications to users can be done through:
   - **Alarms**: Beeping sounds or visual alerts on an embedded device.
   - **Traps**: SNMP traps sent to a network management system.
   - **Syslog**: Logging the event in a syslog server or local file system.

#### 12. **How are you debugging the L2 or L3 protocol?**
   Debugging L2 (Data Link) or L3 (Network) protocols can be done using:
   - **tcpdump** or **wireshark**: Capturing and analyzing network packets.
   - Checking protocol compliance against standards (e.g., RFC2544 for performance benchmarking).
   - Validating the forwarding/routing tables and checking for issues like packet drops, incorrect routes, or protocol negotiation failures.

#### 13. **Do you familiar with IPC?**
   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** allows processes to exchange data. Common IPC mechanisms include:
   - **Pipes**: One process writes, and another reads.
   - **Message Queues**: Messages are placed in a queue by one process and retrieved by another.
   - **Shared Memory**: Memory shared between processes.
   - **Semaphores**: Control access to shared resources.

#### 14. **Do you know interrupt latency, and how to reduce this latency?**
   **Interrupt latency** is the time between the generation of an interrupt and when the CPU starts executing the corresponding interrupt service routine (ISR). To reduce interrupt latency:
   - **Minimize ISR time**: Keep ISRs as short as possible.
   - **Prioritize interrupts**: Assign higher priority to critical interrupts.
   - **Disable unnecessary interrupts**: Reduce the load on the system by disabling non-critical interrupts.

#### 15. **You work on the IRS (interrupt service handler). How is IRS handled?**
   The **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** is executed when an interrupt occurs. It should:
   - Acknowledge the interrupt.
   - Perform minimal processing (usually storing data or setting flags).
   - Clear the interrupt to ensure it doesnâ€™t retrigger.
   - Return control to the main program or scheduler.

   Example of an ISR in C:
   ```c
   void __irq isr_handler(void) {
       // Handle interrupt
       // Clear interrupt flag
   }
   ```

#### 16. **Do you face memory leak issues, and how do you handle them?**
   **Memory leaks** occur when dynamically allocated memory is not freed after use. In C/C++ applications, you can use tools like **valgrind** to detect memory leaks.

   Example (using `valgrind`):
   ```bash
   valgrind --leak-check=full ./my_program
   ```

#### 17. **How can you identify memory leaks?**
   Memory leaks can be identified using:
   - **Tools**: Valgrind for C/C++.
   - **Heap Profiling**: Track the memory usage patterns.
   - Regularly free allocated memory in code.

#### 18. **Scope of static variables**
   Static variables have:
   - **Local scope**: If declared inside a function, the variable retains its value between function calls.
   - **Global scope**: If declared outside functions, the variable is accessible only within the same file.

   Example:
   ```c
   void func() {
       static int count = 0;
       count++;
       printf("%d\n", count);
   }
   ```

#### 19. **What is a semaphore?**
   A **semaphore** is a synchronization primitive used to control access to a shared resource. There are two types of semaphores:
   - **Binary semaphore**: Similar to a lock (value is either 0 or 1).
   - **Counting semaphore**: Allows a specific number of threads to access a resource.

   Example:
   ```c
   sem_t semaphore;
   sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 1); // Initialize binary semaphore
   sem_wait(&semaphore);  // Wait (acquire)
   // Critical section
   sem_post(&semaphore);  // Signal (release)
   ```

#### 20. **SyncE: What is the major function that you implement in this driver?**
   **Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE)** is used for frequency synchronization over Ethernet networks. The major function in a SyncE driver could include:
   - Handling the clock recovery and synchronization mechanisms.
   - Managing the hardware that handles SyncE signals.

#### 21. **Do you have any questions to ask us?**
   This is your chance to ask the interviewer about their team, challenges, or expectations for the role.

### Coding Challenges

#### **CODE: Write a program to reverse a number by using a recursive function**
   Given an input number, write a recursive function to reverse it.

   Example code:
   ```c
   int reverseNumber(int num, int rev) {
       if (num == 

0)
           return rev;
       rev = rev * 10 + (num % 10);
       return reverseNumber(num / 10, rev);
   }

   int main() {
       int number = 123456;
       printf("Reversed: %d\n", reverseNumber(number, 0));
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Input**: `123456`  
   **Output**: `654321`

#### **CODE: Bitwise: How to enable a bit at a given position**
   Use bitwise operations to set (enable) a bit at a given position.

   Example:
   ```c
   int setBit(int num, int pos) {
       return num | (1 << pos);
   }

   int main() {
       int num = 5;    // Binary: 101
       int pos = 1;
       int result = setBit(num, pos);  // Set bit at position 1
       printf("Result: %d\n", result);  // Output: 7 (Binary: 111)
       return 0;
   }
   ```

Let's go through the list of questions from the latest image and provide detailed explanations, code examples, and insights where necessary.

---

### Do Uong

#### 1. **Introduce yourself and last project (focus on kernel project)**
   Here, you should give a brief overview of your background and your most recent project. If you're working on a kernel-related project, discuss:
   - The kernel module or feature you were developing.
   - Any challenges you faced (e.g., concurrency, memory management, low-level hardware interaction).
   - Technologies or tools you used (Linux kernel, device drivers, kernel debugging tools).

   Example:  
   "I am a software engineer with a strong focus on Linux kernel development. My most recent project involved developing a kernel module for monitoring hardware health in embedded systems, using custom watchdog timers and handling interrupts."

#### 2. **What is a watchdog? Softdog? Hardware watchdog?**
   - **Watchdog**: A watchdog timer is a mechanism that resets the system if it detects that the system has become unresponsive or stuck. The system must periodically "pet" or reset the watchdog timer to prevent a system reset.
   
   - **Softdog (Software Watchdog)**: A software watchdog timer implemented in software. It can be less reliable than a hardware watchdog because it depends on the system's software continuing to run properly.

   - **Hardware Watchdog**: A dedicated hardware timer that runs independently of the system's software. Itâ€™s more reliable than a software watchdog because it doesnâ€™t rely on the software continuing to run.

#### 3. **What timer do you use in a watchdog?**
   The timer used in a watchdog is typically:
   - **WDT (Watchdog Timer)** in hardware watchdogs.
   - **Kernel-based software timers** for soft watchdogs, which can be implemented using Linux kernel functions like `schedule_timer()`.

   Example:
   ```c
   void my_watchdog_function(unsigned long data) {
       // Code to handle watchdog timer reset
   }

   struct timer_list my_timer;
   init_timer(&my_timer);
   my_timer.function = my_watchdog_function;
   my_timer.expires = jiffies + msecs_to_jiffies(1000);
   add_timer(&my_timer);
   ```

#### 4. **What is your kernel project actually doing?**
   This depends on the specific project. Example responses could include:
   - Developing device drivers for new hardware.
   - Implementing new scheduling algorithms.
   - Kernel optimization and debugging for real-time systems.
   - Monitoring system health via kernel modules, implementing watchdog functionality, or handling interrupts.

#### 5. **Compare thread and process**
   - **Thread**: A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process. All threads within a process share the same memory space but have their own stack.
   - **Process**: A process is an independent program in execution with its own memory space. Context switching between processes is more expensive than between threads because processes do not share memory.

   | Feature    | Thread                               | Process                            |
   |------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
   | Memory     | Shared between threads of the same process | Each process has its own memory   |
   | Context Switch | Faster (less overhead)              | Slower (more overhead)             |
   | Creation   | Less time to create                  | More time to create                |
   | Use Case   | Used for tasks that share data       | Used for tasks that need isolation |

#### 6. **What is pointer? Memory leak? How to prevent memory leak?**
   - **Pointer**: A variable that stores the address of another variable.
   - **Memory Leak**: Occurs when memory is allocated dynamically but is not freed after use, leading to reduced available memory over time.
   - **Prevention of Memory Leaks**:
     - Always `free()` dynamically allocated memory.
     - Use tools like `valgrind` to detect memory leaks.

   Example:
   ```c
   int* ptr = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int));
   *ptr = 100;
   free(ptr); // Prevent memory leak by freeing the allocated memory
   ```

#### 7. **When do you use the `extern` keyword?**
   The `extern` keyword is used to declare a global variable or function in another file. It tells the compiler that the definition exists elsewhere.

   Example:
   ```c
   // In file1.c
   int global_var = 10;

   // In file2.c
   extern int global_var;  // Declaration of a variable defined in another file
   ```

#### 8. **What is a macro? When do you use a macro? How does the compiler process the macro?**
   - **Macro**: A macro is a preprocessor directive used to define constants or functions that are expanded inline during the preprocessing phase. Macros are processed by the preprocessor before the actual compilation of the program.
   - **When to use**: Macros are useful for defining constants, performing conditional compilation, or creating inline functions for small code snippets that donâ€™t need a function call overhead.

   Example:
   ```c
   #define PI 3.14159
   #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
   ```

   - The compiler replaces instances of `PI` and `SQUARE(x)` during preprocessing with their respective definitions.

#### 9. **Memory layout of a process**
   A typical process memory layout consists of:
   1. **Text Segment**: Contains the compiled code of the program (read-only).
   2. **Data Segment**: Contains initialized global and static variables.
   3. **BSS Segment**: Contains uninitialized global and static variables.
   4. **Heap**: Dynamic memory allocated during runtime via `malloc()` or `calloc()`.
   5. **Stack**: Stores local variables and function call frames.

   Example layout:
   ```
   +--------------------+
   | Stack              |
   +--------------------+
   | Heap               |
   +--------------------+
   | BSS                |
   +--------------------+
   | Data               |
   +--------------------+
   | Text               |
   +--------------------+
   ```

#### 10. **Compare semaphore and mutex**
   - **Mutex**: A mutual exclusion lock that ensures only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. It is binary (locked/unlocked).
   - **Semaphore**: A signaling mechanism used to control access to a resource. It can have multiple permits (not just binary like a mutex).

   | Feature     | Semaphore                      | Mutex                          |
   |-------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
   | Value       | Can be more than 1              | Binary (locked/unlocked)       |
   | Use Case    | Multiple threads/resources      | Single thread/resource         |
   | Ownership   | Any thread can signal           | Must be unlocked by the same thread that locked it |

   Example of using a semaphore:
   ```c
   sem_t semaphore;
   sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 1);  // Initialize a semaphore with 1 permit
   sem_wait(&semaphore);        // Wait (lock)
   // Critical section
   sem_post(&semaphore);        // Signal (unlock)
   ```

       printf("Sum of digits (recursive): %d\n", sum_of_digits_recursive(number));  // Output: 10
       return 0;
   }
   ```

       int data;
       struct Node* next;
   };

   struct Node* head = NULL;

   void insert_at_head(int data) {
       struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
       newNode->data = data;
       newNode->next = head;
       head = newNode;
   }

   void insert_at_tail(int data) {
       struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
       newNode->data = data;
       newNode->next = NULL;
       
       if (head == NULL) {
           head = newNode;
           return;
       }

       struct Node* temp = head;
       while (temp->next != NULL) {
           temp = temp->next;
       }
       temp->next = newNode;
   }
   ```

           newNode->next = head;
           head = newNode;
           return;
       }

       struct Node* temp = head;
       for (int i = 0; i < position - 1 && temp != NULL; i++) {
           temp = temp->next;
       }
       if (temp == NULL) {
           printf("Position out of bounds\n");
           return;
       }

### Thinh Nguyen

#### 1. **Introduce yourself**
   Provide a brief summary of your background, skills, and current experience. You can highlight your experience in driver development, kernel programming, or any embedded systems work.

   Example:  
   "I am an embedded systems engineer with over 4 years of experience in developing Linux device drivers, working on I2C, SPI, and UART protocols, and creating custom kernel modules. I focus on developing drivers for sensors and networking devices."

#### 2. **Tell me the experience in the driver level and application level or interfaces level**
   This question seeks to understand your hands-on experience at various levels of the software stack:
   - **Driver Level**: Working with kernel modules, device drivers, handling hardware interrupts, and communicating with peripherals (e.g., sensors, devices).
   - **Application Level**: Writing user-space applications that interact with the kernel via system calls like `ioctl` or by reading from device files in `/dev/`.
   - **Interface Level**: Developing APIs that sit between the application and driver level.

   Example:  
   "At the driver level, I worked on writing a Linux kernel module for I2C-based temperature sensors, handling interrupts and implementing sysfs interfaces for user applications. At the application level, I developed a C program that reads the sensor values from `/dev/i2c-1` and logs temperature data."

#### 3. **How to implement I2C?**
   I2C communication involves using two lines (SCL and SDA) for clock and data transfer. To implement I2C communication in Linux:
   - Write a kernel driver using I2C APIs provided by the Linux kernel (`i2c_add_driver`, `i2c_transfer`, etc.).
   - You can also communicate using user-space utilities like `i2c-tools`.

   Example (pseudo-code for I2C communication):
   ```c
   struct i2c_adapter *adap;
   struct i2c_msg msg[2];
   u8 addr = 0x50;  // Device address
   u8 buf[10];

   adap = i2c_get_adapter(1);  // Get I2C adapter
   msg[0].addr = addr;
   msg[0].flags = 0;  // Write operation
   msg[0].len = sizeof(buf);
   msg[0].buf = buf;
   i2c_transfer(adap, msg, 1);  // Perform I2C transfer
   ```

#### 4. **Are you controlling the sensor or reading the sensor?**
   In embedded systems, **controlling** the sensor usually involves sending control commands (like calibration or mode changes) via a communication protocol (I2C, SPI, etc.). **Reading** the sensor refers to reading data (temperature, pressure, etc.) from the sensor registers.

   Example:  
   "In my project, I implemented both control and read operations for a temperature sensor using the I2C protocol. I sent configuration commands to set the sensor's operational mode and then read temperature data periodically."

#### 5. **I2C protocol (I2C topology)**
   **I2C Topology** involves a master-slave communication model:
   - **Master**: Controls the clock (SCL) and initiates communication with slaves.
   - **Slaves**: Respond to master commands when addressed.
   - Multiple slave devices can be connected to the same bus.

   Example:  
   "In I2C, the master sends a start condition followed by the slave address and then either sends or requests data. The slaves can be temperature sensors, EEPROMs, or other peripherals."

#### 6. **How is that data passed to the application?**
   Data from kernel space (device driver) can be passed to the application in several ways:
   - **sysfs**: The driver exposes data via the sysfs file system (`/sys/class/...`), and applications can read the data by reading from these files.
   - **ioctl**: The driver uses the `ioctl` system call to allow applications to communicate with the driver.
   - **read/write**: The driver implements `read()` and `write()` methods that the application can invoke to interact with the device.

   Example using `sysfs`:
   ```bash
   cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp  # Application reads temperature
   ```

#### 7. **Have you used any interrupt handling mechanisms?**
   **Interrupt handling** is essential in embedded systems for responding to hardware events (like receiving data from a sensor or detecting a button press).
   - In Linux kernel programming, interrupts are handled using `request_irq()` to register an interrupt handler.
   - Interrupt handlers should be short and efficient to minimize interrupt latency.

   Example:
   ```c
   static irqreturn_t my_irq_handler(int irq, void *dev_id) {
       // Handle interrupt
       return IRQ_HANDLED;
   }

   // Requesting an interrupt
   request_irq(irq_num, my_irq_handler, IRQF_SHARED, "my_device", dev_id);
   ```

#### 8. **Tell me about inter-process communication (IPC)?**
   **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)** allows processes to communicate and share data. Common IPC mechanisms include:
   - **Pipes**: A unidirectional communication channel between processes.
   - **Message Queues**: Allows processes to send and receive messages.
   - **Shared Memory**: Allows multiple processes to access the same memory space.
   - **Semaphores**: Used to synchronize access to shared resources.

   Example (using pipes):
   ```c
   int fd[2];
   pipe(fd);
   if (fork() == 0) {
       // Child process
       close(fd[0]);  // Close reading end
       write(fd[1], "Hello", 5);
   } else {
       // Parent process
       close(fd[1]);  // Close writing end
       read(fd[0], buffer, 5);
   }
   ```

#### 9. **Can you give me some examples of what kind of IPC is?**
   Some examples of IPC mechanisms include:
   - **Named Pipes (FIFOs)**: A pipe that has a name and can be accessed by unrelated processes.
   - **Shared Memory (shmget, shmat)**: Commonly used for sharing large amounts of data.
   - **Message Queues (msgget, msgsnd, msgrcv)**: Allow processes to send and receive messages in a structured way.
   - **Signals**: Used to notify a process of an event.

#### 10. **Do you know anything about block drivers or network drivers?**
   - **Block drivers** handle data stored in block devices like hard disks or SSDs. They handle read/write operations at the block level.
   - **Network drivers** manage the network interface hardware and handle data packet transmission and reception over a network.

   Example:  
   "I have experience with block drivers, especially handling I/O operations using the `request_queue`. I have also worked with network drivers using the `net_device` structure in Linux to handle packet transmission over Ethernet."

#### 11. **Compare between I2C and SPI**
   - **I2C**:
     - Uses 2 wires (SDA, SCL).
     - Multi-master, multi-slave architecture.
     - Slower compared to SPI (typically up to 400kHz for standard mode).
   - **SPI**:
     - Uses 4 wires (MOSI, MISO, SCK, SS).
     - Faster data transfer (up to 10 MHz or more).
     - Simple master-slave communication but does not support multiple masters.

   | Feature      | I2C               | SPI               |
   |--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
   | Number of Wires | 2 (SDA, SCL)       | 4 (MOSI, MISO, SCK, SS) |
   | Speed        | Slower (up to 400kHz) | Faster (up to 10 MHz)    |
   | Architecture | Multi-master/slave   | Single master/slave      |

#### 12. **(FM) How do you check if the user space is hanging or becomes unresponsive to the whole thing?**
   To check if user-space applications are hanging:
   - Use monitoring tools like `top` or `ps` to check the process's CPU usage.
   - Send **signals** like `SIGUSR1` or `SIGKILL` to the process to check its responsiveness.
   - If a process is hung, it might be stuck waiting on a resource, such as a file lock or I/O operation.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ps -ef | grep <process_name>   # Check if process is running
   kill -SIGUSR1 <pid>            # Send user-defined signal
   ```

#### 13. **Did you ever see any complicated issues? Can you tell me that you got stuck with some where you had to brainstorm a lot?**
   This is a behavioral question meant to assess how you approach complex problems. You can describe a situation where you faced an issue such as:
   - A difficult hardware communication bug (e.g., inconsistent I2C data).
   - A synchronization problem in a multithreaded environment.
   - A tricky memory leak or performance bottleneck.

   Example:  
   "In one of my projects, I encountered a memory leak in a multithreaded application. After brainstorming and using tools like `valgrind`, I realized that one of the threads was not properly releasing a dynamically allocated

 buffer under certain error conditions."

#### 14. **If there are multiple clients, how do you handle so you have a server?**
   You can handle multiple clients on a server using:
   - **Threaded Model**: Create a new thread for each client.
   - **Event-Driven Model**: Use an event loop (e.g., `select()` or `epoll()` in Linux) to handle multiple connections within a single thread.

   Example (using `select()`):
   ```c
   fd_set readfds;
   FD_ZERO(&readfds);
   FD_SET(server_fd, &readfds);

   select(max_fd + 1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL);
   ```

#### 15. **What exactly is the use of signal (IPC)?**
   **Signals** are used to notify processes of system events (e.g., `SIGKILL`, `SIGTERM`). Signals can be used as an IPC mechanism to:
   - Interrupt a process.
   - Inform a process to handle specific events (e.g., `SIGALRM` for a timer expiration).
   - Synchronize processes or manage clean termination.

   Example:
   ```c
   void sig_handler(int signum) {
       printf("Received signal %d\n", signum);
   }

   signal(SIGINT, sig_handler);  // Handle Ctrl+C (SIGINT)
   ```

#### 16. **Do you know PoE (Power over Ethernet)?**
   **PoE (Power over Ethernet)** allows Ethernet cables to deliver both data and power to devices like IP cameras, VoIP phones, or wireless access points. It eliminates the need for separate power cables.

   Example:  
   "In one of my networking projects, I used PoE to power a series of IP cameras over a single Ethernet cable. This simplified the installation and reduced the need for additional power outlets."

#### 17. **Can you tell me what all your servers say and what are you doing from client side? (TCP server - client)**

   This question likely asks you to describe the architecture and interaction between a TCP server and its clients:
   - The **server** listens on a port for incoming client connections.
   - The **client** connects to the server and exchanges data.

   Example (pseudo-code for TCP server):
   ```c
   int server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&address, sizeof(address));
   listen(server_fd, 5);  // Server listens for incoming connections
   accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&client_addr, &addrlen);  // Accept a connection
   ```

   On the client side:
   ```c
   int sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   connect(sock, (struct sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));  // Client connects to server
   ```

### Vinh Nguyen

#### 1. **Introduce yourself and last project**
   Start with a brief introduction of your professional background and the last project you worked on. Highlight the technologies, your role (e.g., developer or team lead), and the challenges faced.

   Example:  
   "I am a network software developer with experience in implementing protocols like TCP/IP, developing device drivers, and working with embedded systems. My last project involved implementing a secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) server for an IoT-based data collection system."

#### 2. **Show screen to go through CV in my computer**
   This seems like a request to review your CV on the interviewerâ€™s machine, potentially to discuss your experience in more detail.

#### 3. **Team manager or developer**
   This is about clarifying your role. If you are a **developer**, explain your hands-on work on coding, debugging, and optimizing the system. If you're a **team manager**, discuss how you led the team, coordinated tasks, and handled the technical direction.

#### 4. **SFTP server implemented**
   **SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)** is a protocol that allows secure file transfers over SSH. Discuss the key features of the SFTP server you implemented, such as:
   - Authentication (e.g., password or public-key authentication).
   - Encryption of data in transit.
   - Handling multiple client connections and managing file permissions.

   Example:  
   "In my project, I implemented an SFTP server using OpenSSH libraries. I integrated secure authentication using both password and key-based methods, ensured encryption for all file transfers, and handled concurrent file uploads and downloads."

#### 5. **NETCONF**
   **NETCONF (Network Configuration Protocol)** is used for managing and configuring network devices. It operates over a secure channel (typically SSH) and uses XML for data representation.

   Example:  
   "I worked with NETCONF to automate network device configuration. Using YANG data models, I developed scripts to configure routers and switches over an encrypted NETCONF session, ensuring compliance with network policies."

### Live Coding Tasks

#### 6. **Live Code 1: Giai thá»«a cá»§a 1 sá»‘ (Factorial of a number)**

   Implement the factorial of a number using both iterative and recursive methods.

   - **Iterative approach**:
   ```c
   int factorial(int n) {
       int result = 1;
       for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
           result *= i;
       }
       return result;
   }
   ```

   - **Recursive approach**:
   ```c
   int factorial_recursive(int n) {
       if (n == 0) return 1;
       return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1);
   }
   ```

#### 7. **Loop vs Recursive, advantages and disadvantages**

   - **Loop**: Iterative approach using control statements like `for`, `while`.
     - **Advantage**: Generally more efficient in terms of memory usage, as there is no function call overhead.
     - **Disadvantage**: Can be harder to conceptualize for certain problems that are naturally recursive (e.g., tree traversal).
   
   - **Recursive**: A function calls itself to break down the problem into smaller parts.
     - **Advantage**: Simple and elegant for problems like tree traversals, divide-and-conquer algorithms.
     - **Disadvantage**: Can lead to stack overflow for deep recursion, and has function call overhead.

### Linked List Coding Tasks

#### 8. **Live Code 2: Linked-list insert node**

   Here's an example of inserting a node into a singly linked list.

   ```c
   struct Node {
       int data;
       struct Node* next;
   };

   void insert_at_end(struct Node** head, int data) {
       struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
       newNode->data = data;
       newNode->next = NULL;

       if (*head == NULL) {
           *head = newNode;
           return;
       }

       struct Node* temp = *head;
       while (temp->next != NULL) {
           temp = temp->next;
       }
       temp->next = newNode;
   }
   ```

#### 9. **Live Code 3: Check if a linked list is looped or not (Cycle detection)**

   Use Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm).

   ```c
   int has_cycle(struct Node* head) {
       struct Node* slow = head;
       struct Node* fast = head;

       while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
           slow = slow->next;
           fast = fast->next->next;

           if (slow == fast) {
               return 1;  // Cycle detected
           }
       }
       return 0;  // No cycle
   }
   ```

#### 10. **Solution Code 4: Check if two linked lists are merged (at some point) or not**

   To check if two linked lists merge at some point:
   - Find the length of both lists.
   - Move the pointer of the longer list ahead by the difference in lengths.
   - Traverse both lists simultaneously until the nodes are equal.

   ```c
   struct Node* get_intersection_node(struct Node* head1, struct Node* head2) {
       int len1 = 0, len2 = 0;
       struct Node *temp1 = head1, *temp2 = head2;

       while (temp1 != NULL) {
           len1++;
           temp1 = temp1->next;
       }
       while (temp2 != NULL) {
           len2++;
           temp2 = temp2->next;
       }

       temp1 = head1;
       temp2 = head2;
       if (len1 > len2) {
           for (int i = 0; i < len1 - len2; i++)
               temp1 = temp1->next;
       } else {
           for (int i = 0; i < len2 - len1; i++)
               temp2 = temp2->next;
       }

       while (temp1 != NULL && temp2 != NULL) {
           if (temp1 == temp2)
               return temp1;  // Intersection point found
           temp1 = temp1->next;
           temp2 = temp2->next;
       }
       return NULL;  // No intersection
   }
   ```
Method 2:
```c
struct Node* get_intersection_node(struct Node* head1, struct Node* head2) {
    if (head1 == NULL || head2 == NULL)
        return NULL;

    struct Node *temp1 = head1;
    struct Node *temp2 = head2;

    // Traverse both lists, switching heads when one pointer reaches the end
    while (temp1 != temp2) {
        // Move to the next node or switch to the other list's head
        temp1 = (temp1 == NULL) ? head2 : temp1->next;
        temp2 = (temp2 == NULL) ? head1 : temp2->next;
    }

    // Either both pointers are NULL (no intersection) or both meet at the intersection point
    return temp1;  // or temp2, they will be the same
}

```

#### 11. **Live Code 4: Create a TCP socket server (for all Ethernets are listening), sequence and describe**

   Example of creating a basic TCP server that listens on all available Ethernet interfaces using `INADDR_ANY`.

   ```c
   int main() {
       int server_fd;
       struct sockaddr_in address;
       int addrlen = sizeof(address);

       // Create socket file descriptor
       if ((server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == 0) {
           perror("socket failed");
           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
       }

       // Bind to any IP address (INADDR_ANY)
       address.sin_family = AF_INET;
       address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
       address.sin_port = htons(8080);

       if (bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&address, sizeof(address)) < 0) {
           perror("bind failed");
           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
       }

       // Start listening
       if (listen(server_fd, 3) < 0) {
           perror("listen failed");
           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
       }

       // Accept a client connection
       int new_socket = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&address, (socklen_t*)&addrlen);
       if (new_socket < 0) {
           perror("accept failed");
           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
       }

       printf("Connection established\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### 12. **Handle multiple fd (sockets) for I/O events (select/poll)**

   To handle multiple socket file descriptors, use either `select()` or `poll()` to monitor multiple file descriptors.

   Example using `select()`:
   ```c
   fd_set readfds;
   FD_ZERO(&readfds);
   FD_SET(server_fd, &readfds);

   int max_fd = server_fd;
   int activity = select(max_fd + 1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL);

   if (FD_ISSET(server_fd, &readfds)) {
       // Handle new incoming connection
   }
   ```

### Networking Protocols and Tools

#### 13. **Routing protocol you know, what purpose**
   Some common routing protocols and their purposes:
   - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: Link-state routing protocol that finds the shortest path.
   - **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**: Distance-vector protocol that uses hop count as a routing metric.
   - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: Used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems on the internet.

#### 14. **ARP, ARP table**
   - **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Resolves the MAC address of a device given its IP address.
   - **ARP Table**: Stores mappings between IP addresses and MAC addresses.

   Example of checking the ARP table:
   ```bash
   arp -a
   ```

#### 15. **How packet goes through multiple routers to destination**
   When a packet traverses multiple routers, each router examines the destination IP address in the packet and forwards it to the next router based on its routing table. This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination

.

   - **Hop-by-hop routing**: The packet is forwarded from one router to the next, with each router deciding the best path to forward the packet.

#### 16. **Which command-line to use to show IP**
   - **ifconfig** (deprecated in some systems, replaced by `ip` command in modern systems):
     ```bash
     ifconfig
     ```

   - **ip**:
     ```bash
     ip addr show
     ```

#### 17. **How to show the routing table in the machine**
   - **netstat**:
     ```bash
     netstat -r
     ```
   - **ip**:
     ```bash
     ip route show
     ```

#### 18. **Which data structure should be used for apps to store the routing table**
   A **hash table** can be used to store a routing table because of its fast lookup time (O(1)). Other data structures, like **trie** (used in IP routing), may also be used for prefix matching in routing tables.

### Doan Tran

#### 1. **Where did you use bottom half in your project?**
   A **bottom half** is a mechanism in the Linux kernel used for deferring work that doesn't need to be handled immediately in an interrupt service routine (ISR). It allows the system to handle interrupts quickly and complete non-urgent work later. You might use bottom halves to process data after an interrupt has signaled that data is available.

   Example:  
   "In my project, I used a bottom half to handle the processing of sensor data after an interrupt from the I2C bus indicated that data had been received. I used tasklets to defer this work to a later time."

#### 2. **List types of bottom half. When to use them?**
   In the Linux kernel, there are two main types of bottom halves:
   - **Tasklets**: Lightweight, scheduled in the bottom half of an interrupt.
   - **Workqueues**: More flexible and can be scheduled in the context of any process, including kernel threads.

   - **When to use**:
     - Use **tasklets** for simple, quick tasks that don't involve sleeping or long waits.
     - Use **workqueues** for tasks that may need to sleep or require more complex processing.

#### 3. **Describe IPC. When to use which kind of IPC?**
   **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)** allows processes to communicate and share data. Common IPC mechanisms include:
   - **Pipes**: For parent-child communication within the same system.
   - **Message Queues**: Used for structured message passing between unrelated processes.
   - **Shared Memory**: For fast, direct data sharing between processes.
   - **Semaphores**: To synchronize access to shared resources between processes.

   Example:  
   "I used shared memory when I needed high-performance communication between multiple processes in a real-time system. I also used message queues in cases where process isolation was required, but I needed structured communication between them."

#### 4. **Describe `select`**
   The **`select()`** system call is used to monitor multiple file descriptors (sockets, files, pipes) for reading, writing, or exceptional conditions. It allows a process to wait for one or more I/O events.

   Example:
   ```c
   fd_set readfds;
   FD_ZERO(&readfds);
   FD_SET(socket_fd, &readfds);

   struct timeval timeout;
   timeout.tv_sec = 5;  // Set 5-second timeout
   timeout.tv_usec = 0;

   int activity = select(socket_fd + 1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, &timeout);
   if (FD_ISSET(socket_fd, &readfds)) {
       // Handle socket read event
   }
   ```

#### 5. **Do you know PoE (Power over Ethernet)?**
   **PoE (Power over Ethernet)** allows Ethernet cables to carry both data and electrical power. It eliminates the need for separate power sources for devices like IP cameras, VoIP phones, and access points.

   Example:  
   "In a previous networking project, I integrated PoE to power IP cameras in a surveillance system using a single Ethernet cable, reducing the complexity and cost of installation."

#### 6. **Live code: Return true/false for a bit in a number**
   Example:
   ```c
   bool check_bit(int number, int position) {
       return (number & (1 << position)) != 0;
   }

   int main() {
       int num = 5;  // 5 in binary: 101
       int pos = 2;
       printf("Bit at position %d is %s\n", pos, check_bit(num, pos) ? "set" : "not set");
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### 7. **Live code: Delete a node in a single linked list**
   Example code for deleting a node:
   ```c
   struct Node {
       int data;
       struct Node* next;
   };

   void delete_node(struct Node** head, int key) {
       struct Node* temp = *head, *prev = NULL;

       if (temp != NULL && temp->data == key) {
           *head = temp->next;
           free(temp);
           return;
       }

       while (temp != NULL && temp->data != key) {
           prev = temp;
           temp = temp->next;
       }

       if (temp == NULL) return;

       prev->next = temp->next;
       free(temp);
   }
   ```

#### 8. **Live code: Convert big endian to little endian**
   To convert from **big endian** to **little endian**, swap the bytes of the number.

   Example:
   ```c
   uint32_t convert_endian(uint32_t num) {
       return ((num >> 24) & 0x000000FF) |
              ((num >> 8)  & 0x0000FF00) |
              ((num << 8)  & 0x00FF0000) |
              ((num << 24) & 0xFF000000);
   }

   int main() {
       uint32_t num = 0x12345678;
       printf("Little endian: 0x%x\n", convert_endian(num));
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### 1. **Process memory layout**
   The typical memory layout of a process includes:
   - **Text Segment**: Contains the executable code.
   - **Data Segment**: Holds initialized global and static variables.
   - **BSS Segment**: Contains uninitialized global variables.
   - **Heap**: Used for dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`).
   - **Stack**: Stores local variables, function call frames, and return addresses.

#### 2. **What is the difference between processes and threads?**
   - **Processes**: Independent execution units with their own memory space. Each process runs in its own address space.
   - **Threads**: Lighter execution units that share the same memory space of the process. Multiple threads run within the same process.

   | Feature   | Process                       | Thread                    |
   |-----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
   | Memory    | Separate memory space          | Shared memory              |
   | Overhead  | Higher (process switch)        | Lower (context switch)     |
   | Use Case  | Isolated tasks                 | Concurrent tasks in the same program |

#### 3. **What is IPC?**
   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** refers to the mechanisms that allow processes to communicate and synchronize their actions. Examples of IPC mechanisms include:
   - Pipes
   - Message Queues
   - Shared Memory
   - Semaphores

#### 4. **What is shared memory? How does it work?**
   **Shared Memory** allows multiple processes to access the same memory space for communication. One process writes to the memory, and another process reads from it. Shared memory is one of the fastest IPC mechanisms because it does not require copying data between processes.

   Example:
   ```c
   int shm_id = shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, 1024, IPC_CREAT | 0666);
   char* shm_addr = (char*) shmat(shm_id, NULL, 0);
   ```

#### 5. **Mutex vs Semaphore. Which cases do we use mutex, and which cases do we use semaphore?**
   - **Mutex**: Used to ensure that only one thread accesses a critical section at a time. It is used for mutual exclusion.
   - **Semaphore**: Can be used for signaling or controlling access to a resource pool. It allows multiple threads to access the resource, depending on the semaphore's count.

   | Use Case          | Mutex                               | Semaphore                   |
   |-------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
   | Synchronization    | Only one thread can access a resource | Multiple threads can access a limited resource |
   | Example            | Protecting critical sections        | Managing a thread pool      |

#### 6. **Do you know SQLite?**
   **SQLite** is a lightweight, self-contained SQL database engine that is widely used for local storage in applications. It's embedded directly into applications and doesn't require a separate server process.

#### 7. **Which data structure should be used for apps to store a routing table?**
   The most common data structures used to store routing tables are:
   - **Hash tables**: Provides fast O(1) lookups, making it ideal for IP address lookups in routing tables.
   - **Tries**: Used in IP routing for longest prefix matching.

#### 8. **Live Code: Implement Linked List (insert, remove)**

   - **Insert**:
   ```c
   void insert_at_end(struct Node** head, int data) {
       struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
       newNode->data = data;
       newNode->next = NULL;

       if (*head == NULL) {
           *head = newNode;
           return;
       }

       struct Node* temp = *head;
       while (temp->next != NULL) {
           temp = temp->next;
       }
       temp->next = newNode;
   }
   ```

   - **Remove**:
   ```c
   void delete_node(struct Node** head, int key) {
       struct Node* temp = *head, *prev = NULL;

       if (temp != NULL && temp->data == key) {
           *head = temp->next;
           free(temp);
           return;
       }

       while (temp != NULL && temp

->data != key) {
           prev = temp;
           temp = temp->next;
       }

       if (temp == NULL) return;

       prev->next = temp->next;
       free(temp);
   }
   ```

#### 9. **When do you use a socket?**
   A **socket** is used for communication between two networked machines. It's used to send and receive data over a network. Sockets are used in network programming for both TCP (stream-oriented) and UDP (datagram-oriented) communication.

   Example:
   ```c
   int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
   connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));
   ```

#### 10. **How do we monitor the latency (Network Perf System project)?**
   Latency in a network can be monitored using:
   - **Ping**: Sends ICMP echo requests and measures the round-trip time.
   - **Traceroute**: Measures the time taken for packets to travel through each hop on the network.
   - **Network Performance Tools**: Tools like `iperf`, `tcpdump`, or custom logging mechanisms in network applications.

#### 11. **What is the max of `char`, `unsigned char`, `signed char`; why do we need to have signed and unsigned? Its benefits?**
   - **Signed `char`**: Can represent both positive and negative values, typically ranging from `-128` to `127`.
   - **Unsigned `char`**: Only represents positive values, ranging from `0` to `255`.

   Benefits:
   - **Signed `char`**: Useful when dealing with both positive and negative data.
   - **Unsigned `char`**: Provides a larger positive range and is often used for bit manipulation or data that is strictly non-negative (like ASCII values).

#### 12. **Do you know bootloader?**
   A **bootloader** is a small program that initializes hardware and loads the operating system into memory when the system starts up. In embedded systems, bootloaders like **U-Boot** are used to initialize the CPU, memory, and peripherals and then load the OS.

### Toan Huynh

#### 1. **What is OAM?**
   **OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance)** refers to the tools and protocols used to monitor and manage network infrastructure. OAM is responsible for fault detection, performance monitoring, and diagnostics in networking systems.

   Example:  
   "In Ethernet networks, OAM is often used to monitor link quality, detect faults, and ensure that network performance meets required standards."

#### 2. **Some network protocols are using in OAM?**
   Protocols used in OAM include:
   - **Ethernet OAM (IEEE 802.1ag, Y.1731)**: Used for fault management and performance monitoring in Ethernet networks.
   - **BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection)**: Used to detect faults in communication paths.
   - **MPLS OAM**: Operations, administration, and maintenance in MPLS networks, which includes tools for fault detection and performance monitoring.

#### 3. **What is SFTP's role in OAM?**
   **SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)** may be used in OAM environments for securely transferring logs, configuration files, and performance reports from network devices to centralized monitoring systems or administrators.

#### 4. **OSI and TCP/IP and where to use it?**
   - **OSI Model**: A theoretical seven-layer model used to understand and standardize networking functions.
     - Common use: When learning or explaining networking concepts or troubleshooting at specific layers (e.g., TCP at layer 4, IP at layer 3).
   
   - **TCP/IP Model**: A more practical, four-layer model for real-world networking.
     - Common use: Implementing network communication (e.g., HTTP on TCP/IP stack).

#### 5. **Socket server-client process, and what system calls were used in that process like create, socket, bind?**
   For a basic socket server-client process, these system calls are typically used:
   - `socket()`: Creates a new socket.
   - `bind()`: Binds the socket to an address/port.
   - `listen()`: Listens for incoming connections.
   - `accept()`: Accepts a connection from a client.
   - `connect()`: Used by the client to connect to the server.
   - `send()` and `recv()`: Used to send and receive data.
   - `close()`: Closes the socket.

   Example:
   ```c
   int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&address, sizeof(address));
   listen(sockfd, 5);
   int new_sock = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&client_addr, &addrlen);
   ```

#### 6. **Mutex vs Semaphore?**
   - **Mutex**: Used for mutual exclusion, ensuring that only one thread accesses a resource at a time.
   - **Semaphore**: Can be used to control access to a resource by multiple threads. A counting semaphore can allow more than one thread to access a resource, depending on the semaphore count.

   | Use Case          | Mutex                             | Semaphore                           |
   |-------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
   | Access Control     | One thread at a time              | Multiple threads (depending on count) |
   | Example            | Protect critical sections         | Resource pool (e.g., thread pool)   |

#### 7. **We have a core dump file, how can we extract information from it?**
   A core dump contains the memory state of a program when it crashes. You can extract information using `gdb` (GNU Debugger):
   ```bash
   gdb <executable> <core_file>
   ```
   This allows you to analyze the stack trace, inspect variables, and identify the cause of the crash.

#### 8. **How to use Valgrind to detect memory leaks in C and Python?**
   - For C programs, Valgrind is commonly used to detect memory leaks:
     ```bash
     valgrind --leak-check=full ./your_program
     ```
   
   - For Python programs, memory leaks are rare but can occur. Use tools like **Heapy** or **objgraph** to track memory usage, as Valgrind isn't directly used for Python.

#### 9. **Live code: There are two passages passed to a function. The passages consist of English alphabets only. Write a program to check if the letters of the second passage are present in the first passage.**
   This can be solved using a **hash table** (or array).

   Example:
   ```python
   def check_passage(passage1, passage2):
       letters = [0] * 26
       for char in passage1:
           letters[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1

       for char in passage2:
           if letters[ord(char) - ord('a')] == 0:
               return False
           letters[ord(char) - ord('a')] -= 1
       return True

   print(check_passage("hello world", "hold"))
   ```

### Khiet Nguyen

#### 1. **Introduce yourself?**
   A brief introduction highlighting your background and experience. For example:
   "I am a network systems engineer with 5 years of experience in developing and maintaining network protocols like OSPF, BGP, and SNMP. I have worked on implementing OAM for network performance monitoring."

#### 2. **Let's talk about the OAM project**
   Discuss the key aspects of your OAM project, such as:
   - **Goal**: To monitor and maintain the network's health, detect faults, and manage performance.
   - **Protocols used**: Ethernet OAM, BFD, SNMP.
   - **Challenges**: Implementing low-latency fault detection, handling large-scale networks.

#### 3. **What are the networking protocols used in this project?**
   In an OAM project, you might have used:
   - **Ethernet OAM (IEEE 802.1ag)**: For link monitoring and fault detection.
   - **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**: For network management and device monitoring.
   - **BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection)**: To quickly detect faults in the data path.

#### 4. **Compare TCP and UDP? Which case uses TCP, and which case uses UDP?**
   - **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented protocol with error checking and flow control.
     - **Use Case**: Web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS), file transfers, email (SMTP), and any situation where data integrity is important.
   
   - **UDP**: Unreliable, connectionless protocol with low overhead.
     - **Use Case**: Video streaming, VoIP, gaming, DNS queries, where speed is more critical than reliability.

#### 5. **Do you know ARP? How does it work?**
   **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses within a local network. When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it sends an ARP request asking, "Who has this IP address?". The device with the matching IP responds with its MAC address.

   Example:
   ```bash
   arp -a  # Check the ARP table
   ```

#### 6. **What is SNMP? Application?**
   **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)** is used to monitor and manage devices on a network (routers, switches, servers). It collects data like CPU usage, memory consumption, and network traffic from these devices.
   - **Application**: Network administrators use SNMP to manage devices, detect faults, and gather performance statistics.

#### 7. **Routing protocol, routing table**
   A **routing protocol** defines how routers communicate with each other to exchange information about the network and the best paths to reach a destination.
   - **Routing Table**: Stores information about the best next-hop addresses for routing packets to their destination.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ip route show  # View the routing table in Linux
   ```

#### 8. **What is dying gasp?**
   A **dying gasp** is a signal sent by network equipment (such as modems or routers) when the device loses power but still has enough residual power to send a final notification. This allows network operators to know when a device has lost power.

#### 9. **Do you use TCP or UDP to send data in this feature?**
   This depends on the feature you are discussing:
   - **TCP**: Use for features requiring reliability, such as file transfers or web traffic.
   - **UDP**: Use for features requiring speed and low-latency communication, such as video streaming or real-time gaming.

### Additional Live Coding Tasks

#### 10. **Compare hash map with linked list**
   - **Hash Map**: Offers average O(1) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions, making it faster for large datasets.
   - **Linked List**: Offers O(n) time complexity for searching, but can be more memory efficient for small datasets and allows for dynamic resizing.

#### 11. **Coding: Find factorial using a loop**
   ```c
   int factorial(int n) {
       int result = 1;
       for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
           result *= i;
       }
       return result;
   }
   ```

#### 12. **Coding: Find factorial using recursion**
   ```c
   int factorial_recursive(int n) {
       if (n == 0) return 1;
       return n * factorial_recursive

(n - 1);
   }
   ```

#### 13. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods?**
   - **Loop**:
     - **Advantage**: Efficient in terms of memory (no function call overhead).
     - **Disadvantage**: Code might be less intuitive for recursive problems.
   
   - **Recursion**:
     - **Advantage**: Easier to read and understand for problems naturally suited to recursion (e.g., tree traversals).
     - **Disadvantage**: Higher memory consumption due to function call stack overhead. Can cause stack overflow if the recursion depth is too high.

#### 14. **Coding: Resolve the looping issue of a linked list**
   You can use Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).
   ```c
   int has_cycle(struct Node* head) {
       struct Node *slow = head, *fast = head;
       while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
           slow = slow->next;
           fast = fast->next->next;
           if (slow == fast) {
               return 1;  // Cycle detected
           }
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### 15. **Coding: Find the single element (non-duplicated) in an array using a bitwise XOR operator**
   Example:
   ```c
   int find_single_element(int arr[], int n) {
       int result = 0;
       for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
           result ^= arr[i];  // XOR operation cancels out duplicates
       }
       return result;
   }

   int main() {
       int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4};
       int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
       printf("Single element is %d\n", find_single_element(arr, n));
       return 0;
   }
   ```

### Tam Tran

#### 1. **Introduce yourself and your experience project?**
   You should give a brief summary of your background, your relevant experience, and the most recent project you've worked on.

   Example:  
   "I am a software engineer with over 3 years of experience in networking and systems programming. My most recent project involved developing a multi-threaded TCP server to handle thousands of concurrent client connections for a real-time chat application."

#### 2. **Have you written a client-server program?**
   This question is asking whether you've implemented a client-server architecture before, typically using sockets for communication. You could explain your experience in building either TCP or UDP-based client-server programs.

   Example:  
   "Yes, I have implemented both TCP and UDP-based client-server programs. For a TCP server, I used socket programming in C to create a server that handles multiple clients by using `select()` to multiplex between different socket file descriptors."

#### 3. **How do two processes communicate with each other through sockets?**
   **Sockets** are a method of IPC (Inter-Process Communication) that allows communication between processes, potentially on different machines.

   For two processes to communicate:
   - The **server** creates a socket, binds it to an address, listens for incoming connections, and accepts connections.
   - The **client** creates a socket and connects to the server's address.

   Example of communication steps:
   - **Server**: `socket() -> bind() -> listen() -> accept() -> recv()`
   - **Client**: `socket() -> connect() -> send() -> recv()`

   Example of a simple TCP socket program in C:
   ```c
   // Server side
   int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&address, sizeof(address));
   listen(sockfd, 5);
   int new_sock = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&client_addr, &addrlen);
   recv(new_sock, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);

   // Client side
   int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));
   send(sockfd, "Hello, server", strlen("Hello, server"), 0);
   ```

#### 4. **Is there a limit of how many clients can connect to a server?**
   Yes, there is a limit on the number of clients that can connect to a server, and it depends on several factors:
   - **Operating System Limits**: Each OS has a maximum number of open file descriptors, which limits the number of concurrent socket connections. This can be tuned via system configuration (e.g., increasing the maximum number of file descriptors in Linux using `ulimit`).
   - **Server Implementation**: The server's hardware resources (CPU, memory) and the way the server handles connections (single-threaded, multi-threaded, event-driven) also play a role in determining how many clients it can handle.
   - **Port Limitations**: A server may also run out of available ephemeral ports.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ulimit -n 1024  # Increase the file descriptor limit
   ```

#### 5. **What happens if a client comes up before the server?**
   If a client attempts to connect to a server that is not running yet:
   - In **TCP**: The client's connection attempt will fail, resulting in an error like `Connection refused` because no process is listening on the server's designated port.
   - In **UDP**: The client can send packets, but they may be dropped or lost because there's no server to receive them.

#### 6. **How should a client be written so that it can handle the scenario that the server is not yet up?**
   The client can handle this scenario by implementing **retries** or **exponential backoff**. Instead of failing immediately when the server is unavailable, the client can attempt to reconnect after a certain interval.

   Example (pseudo-code):
   ```c
   int connect_with_retry(int sockfd, struct sockaddr_in* server_addr) {
       int retries = 5;
       while (retries--) {
           if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)server_addr, sizeof(*server_addr)) == 0) {
               return 0;  // Successful connection
           }
           printf("Server not available, retrying...\n");
           sleep(1);  // Wait before retrying
       }
       return -1;  // Failed after retries
   }
   ```

#### 7. **There are two passages passed to a function. The passages consist of English alphabets only. Write a program to check if the letters of the second passage are present in the first passage (Coding requires bitwise operator).**

   This problem can be solved by representing the presence of each character as a bit in an integer (bitwise operations). We can create a bitmask for each passage and then check if the second bitmask is a subset of the first one.

   Here's how we can use bitwise operators for this task:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdbool.h>

   bool are_all_chars_present(const char* passage1, const char* passage2) {
       int char_map1 = 0, char_map2 = 0;

       // Build bitmask for passage1
       for (int i = 0; passage1[i] != '\0'; i++) {
           char_map1 |= (1 << (passage1[i] - 'a'));
       }

       // Build bitmask for passage2
       for (int i = 0; passage2[i] != '\0'; i++) {
           char_map2 |= (1 << (passage2[i] - 'a'));
       }

       // Check if passage2's bitmask is a subset of passage1's bitmask
       return (char_map1 & char_map2) == char_map2;
   }

   int main() {
       const char* passage1 = "helloworld";
       const char* passage2 = "hold";
       if (are_all_chars_present(passage1, passage2)) {
           printf("All characters of passage2 are present in passage1\n");
       } else {
           printf("Not all characters of passage2 are present in passage1\n");
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   - **Explanation**: 
     - We use an integer `char_map1` to store the presence of each character in `passage1` by setting the corresponding bit to 1.
     - Similarly, we build `char_map2` for `passage2`.
     - Finally, we check if `char_map2` is a subset of `char_map1` using the bitwise AND operation.

### Thanh Nguyen

#### 1. **Introduce yourself**
   Provide a brief overview of your professional background, technical skills, and recent projects.

   Example:  
   "I am an embedded systems engineer with 4 years of experience in developing firmware for IoT devices, focusing on low-level programming, network protocols, and C/C++ development. My recent project involved integrating a Dying Gasp mechanism in a network device to notify power failures."

#### 2. **Brief on that point on that feature what you have worked on the dying gasp**
   The **dying gasp** mechanism refers to the process where a device sends a final message when it detects an imminent power failure. This message is usually sent over the network to inform a central management system of the loss of power.

   Example:  
   "I implemented the dying gasp feature on a Power over Ethernet (PoE) device, which sends a notification to the network management system before the power loss. We used a capacitor to store enough energy to transmit the last packet."

#### 3. **Details about what did I do on dying gasp mechanism**
   You can discuss the technical specifics of your role in implementing the dying gasp mechanism, such as:
   - Ensuring thereâ€™s enough residual power (using capacitors or backup power) for the device to send a final message.
   - Writing the firmware that triggers the dying gasp event when power loss is detected.
   - Ensuring the reliability of the message delivery through protocols like SNMP or BFD.

#### 4. **The difference between Inline and Macros in C**
   - **Inline Function**: A hint to the compiler to replace the function call with the function code itself, but the compiler may ignore this hint.
   - **Macro**: A preprocessor directive that replaces the code at compile time. It's typically used for constants or small code snippets.

   | Feature           | Inline Function                      | Macro                      |
   |-------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|
   | Type              | Function                              | Preprocessor directive      |
   | Error Checking    | Type-checked                          | No type-checking            |
   | Debugging         | Easier to debug                       | Harder to debug             |

   Example:
   ```c
   inline int square(int x) {
       return x * x;
   }

   #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
   ```

#### 5. **What is a recursive function?**
   A **recursive function** is a function that calls itself. It is commonly used to solve problems that can be divided into subproblems of the same type.

   Example:
   ```c
   int factorial(int n) {
       if (n == 0) return 1;
       return n * factorial(n - 1);
   }
   ```

#### 6. **What is the use of `extern` keyword in C language?**
   The `extern` keyword is used to declare a variable or function that is defined in another file. It tells the compiler that the definition of the variable or function exists elsewhere.

   Example:
   ```c
   // file1.c
   int globalVar = 10;

   // file2.c
   extern int globalVar;
   ```

#### 7. **Give an example of using an `extern` or write a format of the `extern`?**
   Example:
   ```c
   // Declaration of an external variable
   extern int externalVar;

   // Definition in another file
   int externalVar = 20;
   ```

#### 8. **What is the difference between structure and union in C?**
   - **Structure**: All members are stored in separate memory locations, and you can access all members at the same time.
   - **Union**: All members share the same memory location, and you can access only one member at a time.

   Example:
   ```c
   struct MyStruct {
       int x;
       float y;
   };

   union MyUnion {
       int x;
       float y;
   };
   ```

#### 9. **What do you know about dynamic memory allocation?**
   **Dynamic memory allocation** in C allows programs to allocate memory during runtime using functions like `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()`.

   Example:
   ```c
   int* ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);  // Allocating memory for 10 integers
   free(ptr);  // Freeing the allocated memory
   ```

#### 10. **What is a process and what is a thread?**
   - **Process**: An independent program in execution with its own memory space.
   - **Thread**: A smaller unit within a process that shares the same memory space but can run independently.

   | Feature   | Process                              | Thread                            |
   |-----------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
   | Memory    | Separate memory space                | Shared memory space               |
   | Overhead  | Higher                               | Lower                             |
   | Use Case  | Running independent programs         | Concurrent execution within a program |

#### 11. **How is memory allocated in case of a process and a thread?**
   - **Process**: Has its own independent memory, including a text segment, data segment, heap, and stack.
   - **Thread**: Shares the heap and global memory with other threads in the same process but has its own stack.

#### 12. **Coding: Write a sample program to calculate the power of a number using recursion function**
   Example:
   ```c
   int power(int base, int exp) {
       if (exp == 0) return 1;
       return base * power(base, exp - 1);
   }

   int main() {
       int base = 2, exp = 3;
       printf("Result: %d\n", power(base, exp));  // Output: 8
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### 13. **How can we override a defined macro?**
   In C, you can redefine a macro by using `#undef` before defining it again.

   Example:
   ```c
   #define MAX 100
   #undef MAX
   #define MAX 200
   ```

#### 14. **Why do we use `void`?**
   The `void` keyword is used in three contexts:
   - **Void function**: A function that does not return a value.
   - **Void pointer**: A pointer that can point to any data type.
   - **Void parameter list**: A function that takes no arguments.

   Example:
   ```c
   void display() {
       printf("This is a void function\n");
   }
   ```

#### 15. **Do you aware of IPC (Inter-Process Communication)?**
   **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)** refers to mechanisms that allow processes to communicate and synchronize with each other. Common IPC methods include:
   - **Pipes**
   - **Message Queues**
   - **Shared Memory**
   - **Semaphores**

#### 16. **What is semaphore, use case of semaphore?**
   A **semaphore** is a synchronization tool used to control access to a shared resource in a concurrent system.
   - **Use Case**: Used to manage resource pools, like controlling access to a finite number of database connections.

   Example:
   ```c
   sem_t semaphore;
   sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 1);  // Initialize semaphore with value 1
   sem_wait(&semaphore);        // Decrease (lock)
   // Critical section
   sem_post(&semaphore);        // Increase (unlock)
   ```

#### 17. **What is a pointer in C? Why do we use pointers?**
   A **pointer** is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are used to:
   - Access memory directly.
   - Pass large data structures (like arrays) efficiently to functions.
   - Dynamically allocate memory.

   Example:
   ```c
   int x = 10;
   int* ptr = &x;  // Pointer to the variable x
   ```

#### 18. **Have you come across any memory leak issues?**
   A **memory leak** occurs when dynamically allocated memory is not properly freed. This can lead to a gradual reduction in available memory and system crashes over time.
   - To prevent memory leaks, ensure that every `malloc()` is matched by a `free()`.

   Example of checking for leaks:
   ```bash
   valgrind --leak-check=full ./program
   ```

#### 19. **Coding: Write a sample code to check if two numbers are equal without using `==`, like using bitwise operator**
   Example:
   ```c
   bool are_equal(int x, int y) {
       return (x ^ y) == 0;  // XOR of two equal numbers will result in 0
   }
   ```

#### 20. **How to check whether a linked list is circular?**
   You can use Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare) to detect cycles in a linked list.

   Example:
   ```c
   bool is_circular(struct Node* head) {
       struct Node *slow = head, *fast = head;
       while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
           slow = slow->next;
           fast = fast->next->next;
           if (slow == fast) {
               return true;  // Cycle detected
           }
       }
       return false;  // No cycle
   }
   ```

#### 21. **If the

 device has failed to send a message on power loss, how will you debug? (Dying gasp)**
   To debug the failure of a dying gasp message:
   - Check if thereâ€™s enough residual power left to send the message.
   - Ensure the network interface is up and the message queue is not blocked.
   - Use logs or debugging tools like `tcpdump` to ensure the message is leaving the device.
   - Verify the correct implementation of the protocol (e.g., SNMP, BFD) that sends the dying gasp.

#### 22. **Have you worked on any protocols, networking protocols?**
   Provide details of any networking protocols youâ€™ve worked on, such as:
   - **TCP/IP**: Connection management, packet transmission.
   - **SNMP**: For monitoring and managing network devices.
   - **Ethernet OAM**: For fault detection and network performance monitoring.

### Chau Nguyen

#### 1. **Introduce yourself and your projects**
   Provide a brief introduction about your background and the projects you've worked on, especially focusing on the relevant technical experience.

   Example:  
   "I am a software engineer specializing in embedded systems and Linux kernel driver development. Recently, I integrated a GPIO driver into the Linux kernel, where I handled both hardware interfacing and low-level debugging."

#### 2. **What are the steps that you have taken to integrate GPIO driver into the Linux kernel?**
   The basic steps for integrating a GPIO driver into the Linux kernel include:
   1. **Understanding the hardware**: Identify the specific GPIO hardware you are working with.
   2. **Writing the device tree bindings**: Define the GPIO pins and their properties in the device tree (for ARM-based systems).
   3. **Writing the driver code**: Implement the necessary callbacks, such as `gpio_request()`, `gpio_direction_input/output()`, and `gpio_set_value()`.
   4. **Registering the driver**: Use `gpiochip_add()` or `platform_driver_register()` to register the driver with the kernel.
   5. **Debugging and testing**: Test the driver using `sysfs` or by writing a user-space application to control the GPIO pins.

#### 3. **What kind of issues have you faced, and how have you debugged those issues? (GPIO driver integration)**
   Common issues during GPIO driver integration include:
   - **Incorrect pin configuration**: You may face issues with wrong pin numbers or modes in the device tree.
   - **Interrupt handling issues**: Problems in configuring and triggering GPIO interrupts.
   - **Debugging Tools**:
     - Use `dmesg` to check the kernel logs for debugging information.
     - Use `gpio` command-line tools like `gpioinfo` from `libgpiod` to verify GPIO states.
     - Add `printk()` statements to the driver to log internal states during driver execution.

#### 4. **What were the features that you have implemented? (GPIO driver integration)**
   - **Basic GPIO control**: Setting pins as input or output, reading/writing pin values.
   - **Interrupt handling**: Enabling GPIO pins to trigger interrupts on rising/falling edges.
   - **Debouncing**: Implementing software debouncing for buttons to prevent multiple trigger signals.
   - **Sysfs interface**: Exposing GPIO control via the `/sys/class/gpio` interface for user-space access.

#### 5. **Can you write the boot-up sequence?**
   The boot-up sequence in embedded systems usually follows these steps:
   1. **Power on/reset**: Hardware initializes.
   2. **Bootloader execution**: The bootloader (like U-Boot) initializes hardware, sets up memory, and loads the kernel.
   3. **Kernel initialization**: The kernel decompresses itself, sets up low-level drivers (GPIO, I2C, etc.), mounts the root filesystem, and starts system processes.
   4. **Init process**: The `init` process starts, running startup scripts and initializing services.

#### 6. **What is the semaphore? How do we make use of semaphore?**
   A **semaphore** is a synchronization primitive used to control access to a shared resource by multiple threads or processes.
   - **Use Case**: Semaphores can be used to control access to a critical section or a limited resource (like a thread pool or file descriptor limit).

   Example:
   ```c
   sem_t semaphore;
   sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 1);  // Initialize with a value of 1

   sem_wait(&semaphore);  // Decrease the semaphore (lock)
   // Critical section
   sem_post(&semaphore);  // Increase the semaphore (unlock)
   ```

#### 7. **Can you tell me what are the format specifiers in C?**
   Format specifiers in C are used with `printf()` and `scanf()` to define the type of data being printed or read. Common format specifiers include:
   - `%d`: Integer
   - `%f`: Floating-point
   - `%s`: String
   - `%c`: Character
   - `%x`: Hexadecimal
   - `%p`: Pointer

#### 8. **What is the static variable in C? Scope of the static variable? Write an example**
   A **static variable** in C retains its value between function calls. It is only visible within the file or function where it is defined (depending on whether it's a global or local static variable).

   - **Local static**: Retains value between function calls but is local to the function.
   - **Global static**: Restricts visibility to the file where itâ€™s declared.

   Example:
   ```c
   void counter() {
       static int count = 0;  // Static variable retains value between calls
       count++;
       printf("%d\n", count);
   }

   int main() {
       counter();  // Output: 1
       counter();  // Output: 2
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### 9. **What is enumeration?**
   **Enumeration** is a user-defined data type in C that consists of named integer constants. It is useful for representing a set of related constants with meaningful names.

   Example:
   ```c
   enum week {Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday};

   enum week today = Friday;
   ```

#### 10. **What is a macro? Why do we use it?**
   A **macro** in C is a fragment of code that is replaced by the preprocessor before compilation. It is used to define constants or reusable code snippets.

   Example:
   ```c
   #define PI 3.14159
   #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

   printf("Square of 4 is %d\n", SQUARE(4));  // Output: 16
   ```

#### 11. **What is the inline function?**
   An **inline function** is a hint to the compiler to replace the function call with the actual function code. This reduces the overhead of a function call, especially for small, frequently called functions.

   Example:
   ```c
   inline int square(int x) {
       return x * x;
   }
   ```

#### 12. **Do you know about the `volatile` keyword?**
   The **`volatile`** keyword tells the compiler that the value of a variable can be changed unexpectedly (e.g., by hardware or another thread). It prevents the compiler from optimizing reads/writes to this variable.

   Example:
   ```c
   volatile int flag = 0;  // Prevents compiler from optimizing accesses to `flag`
   ```

#### 13. **What is a pointer? Write a small program using a pointer**
   A **pointer** is a variable that stores the address of another variable.

   Example:
   ```c
   int x = 10;
   int* ptr = &x;  // Pointer to x

   printf("Value of x: %d\n", *ptr);  // Dereference pointer to get the value of x
   ```

#### 14. **`const char* ptr` and `char *const ptr` -> Write an example for each use case**
   - **`const char* ptr`**: A pointer to a constant character. You can change where the pointer points, but you cannot change the value it points to.
   - **`char* const ptr`**: A constant pointer to a character. You can change the value the pointer points to, but you cannot change the pointer itself.

   Example:
   ```c
   const char* ptr1 = "Hello";  // You cannot modify the value at ptr1
   ptr1 = "World";  // This is allowed

   char* const ptr2 = "Hello";  // You cannot modify where ptr2 points
   *ptr2 = 'W';  // This is allowed (if the memory is writable)
   ```

#### 15. **What is static memory allocation and dynamic memory allocation?**
   - **Static memory allocation**: Memory is allocated at compile-time (e.g., global and static variables).
   - **Dynamic memory allocation**: Memory is allocated at runtime using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, or `realloc()`.

   Example of dynamic memory allocation:
   ```c
   int* arr = (int*)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));  // Allocating memory for 10 integers
   free(arr);  // Freeing the allocated memory
   ```

#### 16. **Which data structure is mainly using static memory allocation?**
   Data structures like **arrays** use static memory allocation because their size is fixed at compile-time.

   Example:
   ```c
   int arr[10];  // Statically allocated array of size 10
   ```

#### 17. **Compare TCP and UDP**
   - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Reliable, connection-oriented protocol that guarantees data delivery and ensures packets arrive in order.
     - Use cases: File transfers, web browsing, emails.
   - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Unreliable, connectionless protocol with no guarantees for packet delivery, but with lower overhead.
     - Use cases: Streaming, gaming, DNS queries.

#### 18. **If the package is lost in both TCP and UDP, what happens?**
   - **In TCP**: The protocol will detect the lost packet and retransmit it, ensuring that the data arrives intact

.
   - **In UDP**: No action is taken. If a packet is lost, it is simply discarded, and the application must handle any potential loss.

#### 19. **Write a sample program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion**
   Example:
   ```c
   int fibonacci(int n) {
       if (n == 0) return 0;
       if (n == 1) return 1;
       return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
   }

   int main() {
       for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
           printf("%d ", fibonacci(i));
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### 20. **Do you know what is ISR?**
   An **ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)** is a function that is executed when an interrupt is triggered by hardware or software. It handles interrupt events and performs quick tasks before handing control back to the main program.

   Example:
   ```c
   void __irq my_isr(void) {
       // Handle interrupt
   }
   ```
